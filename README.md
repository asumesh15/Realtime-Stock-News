We can see on the dashboard that most of the activity tends to happen during the earlier hours of the market (9:00-10:00 AM)

Through the Kibana user interface we can see the structure of the logs including the various fields that are being tracked.

Here (also a part of the Kibana dashboard) we see the top 10 users whose tweets we have captured. This info may be useful if you would like to follow an account that breaks news fast.
